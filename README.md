# Bounce Animation with CSS

This project demonstrates a **bounce animation** using **CSS**. The ball moves both **horizontally** (left to right) and **vertically** (up and down), creating a dynamic effect inside a container.


## Features

- **CSS Keyframe Animation**: Uses `@keyframes` to create both horizontal and vertical bounce effects.
- **No JavaScript**: Pure CSS solution.
- **Customizable**: Easily tweak the speed, bounce distance, and more.

## Installation

To use this animation in your own project, simply copy the HTML and CSS code into your files.

    ```bash
    git clone (https://github.com/samarthchawla2005/Bounce-Animation.git)
